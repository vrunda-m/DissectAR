# 🧠 Dissect AR  
**An Augmented Reality platform for interactive anatomy learning**

---

## 🔍 Overview
Dissect AR is an AR-based educational project designed to transform how anatomy is learned.  
Instead of static diagrams, learners interact with **3D anatomical models** using Augmented Reality, enabling virtual dissections, layered exploration, and immersive understanding.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional anatomy education relies heavily on textbooks, 2D visuals, and limited access to physical labs. This creates gaps in spatial understanding and engagement.

---

## 💡 Solution
Dissect AR bridges this gap by offering:
- Real-time AR visualization of organs
- Interactive layer-by-layer dissection
- Device-based exploration without physical specimens

---

## 🚀 Features
- 📱 Marker-based / model-based AR visualization  
- 🧩 Interactive 3D anatomical models  
- 🔍 Zoom, rotate, and isolate organs  
- 🧠 Designed for students, educators, and self-learners  
- 🌐 Web-based backend for scalability  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend / AR**: Web-based AR (A-Frame / Three.js / AR.js)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Runtime**: JavaScript
- **Package Manager**: npm
